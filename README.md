## SMART WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

SWMS uses AI-driven waste classification to optimize disposal, providing real-time guidance and recycling center recommendations for efficient waste management.

##  ABSTRACT

Waste mismanagement has become one of the most pressing global environmental challenges,leading to land pollution, resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions. As urban populations grow and consumer waste increases, the need for an efficient, scalable, and intelligent waste management system becomes critical. Traditional waste disposal methods heavily rely on manual sorting, which is often inefficient and prone to errors. Many recyclable and compostable materials end up in landfills due to a lack of awareness, inefficient waste segregation, and limited access to proper disposal facilities. The Smart Waste Management System (SWMS) aims to revolutionize waste disposal through.AI-driven waste classification, mobile/web-based user interaction, and real-time recycling center recommendations. This system leverages modern technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), cloud computing, and location-based services, to improve waste disposal efficiency. By enabling users to scan waste items using a mobile camera, the system categorizes waste into recyclables, compost, or landfill waste and provides proper disposal guidance. Additionally, it integrates with Google Maps API to suggest nearby recycling centers and offers personalized waste reduction tips.
